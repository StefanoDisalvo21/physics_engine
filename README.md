# Physics Engine Gravity Simulation🌍
## About
    The project started during my last year
    of high school and aims to apply physics
    knowledge without leaving it only concepts.
    Thus I thought to build a 3D physics engine taht 
    simulates gravity, with the help of raylib
    The project itself isn't anything new but it
    has been thought to be a way to learn different
    things (see goals) and apply maths/phisics which are 
    some of my biggest passions.
    Updates will be delivered as soon as I can
    but there is no delivery date.
    I started to work on project like that
    because I wanted to do more than we do
    in high  school so here I am doing errors and
    trying to improve daily.
## Goals 🎯
    - Learn how to apply physics and maths
    - Improve "software design" skills
